Introduction
The smart strings are implemented in four different ways :
1.	Copied Pointers
2.	Owned Pointers
3.	Reference Couting with COW
4.	Reference Linking with COW
When opned in Visual studio, these file are seen :
1.	StringBuffer_1: Declaration of StringBuffer class with copied pointers.
2.	StringBuffe_2: Declaration of StringBuffer class with Owned Pointers.
Testing
The test case provides a test for all the four ways the strings are handled.
Assumptions
The internal resource pointer starts pointing to the character passed when the constructor is used. Hence no data is copied from the passed buffer.
The reserve function is treated as a starting point for StringBuffer objects. Reserve function must be called with a specific size one can append or read from the StringBuffer object. If appended without calling reserve an exception is thrown.
How to run
Download the project on VS. the main function calls the four test cases.
